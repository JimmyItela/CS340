Project Two 
1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In this course, I learned to write maintainable and adaptable code by following modular design principles and clear documentation practices. The CRUD Python module emphasized separating database logic from the dashboard interface, allowing for easy updates or bug fixes without changing the entire system. Consistent variable naming, inline comments, and testing also improved readability and collaboration. By linking the dashboard widgets directly to the database, I ensured scalability and adaptability for future feature additions.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach each problem through systematic analysis and logical decomposition. For Project Two, I analyzed the data requirements and functionality of the CRUD module before implementing it. I relied on prior knowledge from earlier courses—like data structures and algorithm efficiency—to ensure that database operations were optimized. By using iterative testing and debugging, I ensured the final solution met user needs and aligned with software engineering best practices.

3. How do you approach developing programs for a company like Grazioso Salvare?
Working on a project like Grazioso Salvare required understanding both the client’s mission and the technical requirements. My approach focused on designing a reliable CRUD interface that allowed users to easily access and filter animal data for rescue operations. Using MongoDB made it possible to handle large datasets efficiently. I would continue improving such a project by adding role-based access control and advanced search features to better support the company’s workflow.

4. What skills or strategies did you use in this project that you learned from previous assignments or courses?
This project built upon my experience with Python, data modeling, and dashboard visualization from earlier courses. I applied knowledge of object-oriented programming (from CS-320 and CS-300) to structure the CRUD module and ensure data consistency. I also incorporated techniques from database design (CS-340) and visualization tools (CS-330) to make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly. These combined skills helped me create a cohesive and professional-grade system.

5. Why does this kind of work matter?
This type of development work is valuable because it bridges the gap between data and decision-making. By developing dynamic dashboards and robust CRUD operations, companies like Grazioso Salvare can save time, improve rescue coordination, and make data-driven decisions. Additionally, this project demonstrates my ability to integrate full-stack technologies, preparing me for future roles in database-driven software engineering.
